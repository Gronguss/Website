    <p> Hi, I'm Rowan Watson (aka Gronguss), welcome to my webspace! I'm a Melbourne based full-time mechatronics and robotics student, and part time kitchen manager. In my spare time I love playing indie games and my guitar. I love working on creative projects and learning about the world, and this is my place to share what I'm learning and developing. </p>
    <p> My current projects are very small, because I am not sure how much time I will have to dedicate to them, but I will enjoy the process and I hope you will too!</p>
    <p> I do want to have a drop down menu here, im envisioning dark green, with a lighter green general background (figured it out!!) (I love green) and some custom art down the sides of the page in desktop view (not for mobile??) (less for mobile). At the moment i have no idea what I'm doing with colour editing and adding custom art to the page. I want the drop down menus to be split into tips and tricks that ive picked up, projects, devlogs, and an 'about me' homepage. I also will make a logo and such when i have the time.</p>
    <p> It seems that (aside from a Lot of trial and error) i will be referencing a lot of Geeksforgeeks and w3schools (like any pro coder) for making this website</p>
