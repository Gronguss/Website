    <p> Hi, I'm Rowan Watson (aka Gronguss), welcome to my webspace! I'm a Melbourne based full-time mechatronics and robotics student, and part time kitchen manager. In my spare time I love playing indie games and my guitar. I love working on creative projects and learning about the world, and this is my place to share what I'm learning and developing. </p>
    <p> My current projects are very small, because I am not sure how much time I will have to dedicate to them, but I will enjoy the process and I hope you will too!</p>
